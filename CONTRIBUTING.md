## How can I help?

Check [Issues](https://github.com/kaiwahour/home/issues). If you have identified a bug, have an idea for an improvement, etc. please create a new issue.

**Don't edit the `master` branch directly**. Instead, fork the repository on your GitHub account (or make a new feature branch if you are already one of the project's core contributors) and make your changes on that branch. Communicate with the rest of the team in the Issue thread for the Issue you are working on. Once you are done, make a pull request.

For more info on the technical aspects of contributing, adhere to [these instructions](https://github.com/MarcDiethelm/contributing/blob/master/README.md) by [Mark Diethelm](https://github.com/MarcDiethelm).

Do contribute to the [Wiki](https://github.com/kaiwahour/home/wiki) if there is something worth documenting about a particular aspect of this project you are working on.
