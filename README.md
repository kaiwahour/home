## Getting started

To build the website, first `git clone` this repository. Then from the command
line, run:

```bash
yarn install

```

Start the development server with

```bash
yarn start
```

### Problems with `yarn`?

First, try deleting `yarn.lock` and the `/node_modules` directory (if it exists). Then run `yarn`, and if that succeeds, run `yarn update`.
