    <h1>About Kaiwa Hour</h1>
    <p>
      Kaiwa Hour is a place for Japanese-speaking and English-speaking 
      students to meet and openly communicate. We hope that Kaiwa Hour 
      continues to be a place for fostering conversation and understanding 
      as it has been for many generations of students in the past.
    </p>     

    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>
      Kaiwa Hour began approximately 15 years ago with about 40 students from a
      Japanese university visiting the USA who wanted to become tutors. Since there
      was not enough room for all these students to serve in this way, the Japanese
      department at UCD began a new class under the name of “coffee hour.” Since
       then, that class has grown into Kaiwa Hour ("Japanese Conversation Hour").
